### Future releases

Future releases would see features implemented that were not finished now and quality of life tweaks to make the app more enjoyable to use. A few examples:

* **Newsstream**: view latest checkins, challenges, earned trophies from yourself, friends or your current location upon opening the app.
* **Create your own events/POI**
* **Integrate events with device's calendar**: allow the user to create reminders for events listed in the app.
* **Discussion boards/comments system**: discussing POI (in addition to add comments to your checkin), events, challenges, user profiles, trophies,... would be a nice social addition to engage the users with each other
* **RSVP**: allow users to RSVP to events
