### Future releases

Future releases would see features implemented that were not finished now and quality of life tweaks to make the app more enjoyable to use. A few examples:

* **Newsstream**: view latest checkins, challenges, earned trophies from yourself, friends or your current location upon opening the app.
* **Create your own events**
* **Integrate events with device's calendar**: allow the user to create reminders for events listed in the app.
