Another app that uses GEO information is Foursquare. This app allows to check-in at various Point of interests. From somebodies coach to a public event. Our app also allows to check-in but only at public places who are interesting for all the users. The primary goal of studgent is to discover new places and events, not to know where your friends are. Foursquare is not usable to do this because the shown POI's are not useful for all students.
Both studgent and foursquare have one feature in common: the challenges. In foursquare you can 'challenge' your friends by earning badges. This is also possible in our app. Studgent has the advantage that points can also be earned by other challenges like a quiz or the 'Am I Drunk' game.
