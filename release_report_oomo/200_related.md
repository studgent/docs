The app that comes closest to our idea is the “Visit Ghent” app for Android. This app is a tourist guide for people who are visiting the city of Ghent. They promise to offer a full guide for the city, from history to local pubs. Also there is a social media integration called “FanWall”. In this part of the app you can post pictures, post wall posts and 'login with Facebook'.

Even if some people see students as tourists, this app is almost worthless for the average student. The app is too focused on static events like buildings and history and less about the present and the future. With our app you can see the upcoming events and the latest new for a certain Point Of Interest.

The 'fanwall' corner is a good step ahead for making it a dynamic and social app but unfortunately the developers were not very inventive and just made a front-end for Facebook. Our student guide will be much more interactive with our integrated friendslist and various challenges.
The biggest drawback of this app is the price. Instead of earning money through advertising, the owner asks almost €2 for his app.

Another Android app that is about Ghent is the “Toeristisch Gent WtC NL” app. The only similarity between this app and ours is that it is about the same city. This app takes you on a 5km long walk through the center of the city. When you arrive at a certain checkpoint you can open a new page that shows information about the place you are standing near, or think you are standing near because there is not any support for GPS. There is not even a mapview to see an overview of the walk, you just have to follow the written instructions on your mobile device.

On the world wide web there are a couple of websites which aim for the same functions as our app. The biggest and most known website is the site www.guido.be. This website is known by students because “guido” makes a paper city guide for students every year. On their website you can search for events, recreational places, pubs and even look for a job. If these people should build an app or make the website more smartphone friendly it would be a fierce competitor.

The biggest advantage that these guys have, is the massive amount of data they already collected. All this data is shown on their website. If they would like to make a mobile app, they have to find a way to show as much information as possible on a small screen.
Another feature that could use an update is the filter function. At this moment only some basic filtering is implemented. They also don't use any mapview to make a quick search possible by location, a very important parameter for a student who almost always goes by foot.
Another feature that they could make is an interactive part. The only interaction possibility now is that you can like and react to every page with your Facebook account.

Another usefull website is http://www.cafeplan.be/o/city/Gent/1. This website has the same basic as our app: a quick mapview with various points of interest.
When you click on a pub you get more information about the place like the theme, music style, category and a short description of the pub. But unfortunately that is it. The website would be a much bigger success if they have integrated more features like check-ins and the possibility to write a review about the place. All the data on this site is static, there is not even the possibility to add a pub.

The best known app that uses GEO information is Foursquare. This app allows to check-in at various Point of interests. From somebodies coach to a public event. Our app also allows to check-in but only at public places who are interesting for all the users. The primary goal of studgent is to discover new places and events, not to know where your friends are. Foursquare is not usable to do this because the shown POI's are not useful for all students.
Both studgent and foursquare have one feature in common: the challenges. In foursquare you can 'challenge' your friends by earning badges. This is also possible in our app. Studgent has the advantage that points can also be earned by other challenges like a quiz or the 'Am I Drunk' game.
