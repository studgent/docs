### Final result

We feel like our final result matches our expectations very closely. The biggest feature that is lacking is NFC technology for making friends, mainly because we did not have access to devices with NFC. Other than that, there are only some very minor features (eg. registration, news-stream) not implemented because we set priorities on features that were more important.
Implementing these missing features would technically mean we would be repeating the same work (eg. fetching data and posting to backend was already handled with POI/Events, login system).
