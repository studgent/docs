### Intended audience & usage context


The intended users for our app are students who are new to the city in which they are studying and are not yet familiar with all of the interesting places and wish to know a bit more about a place they are visiting. But of course, this is not restricted to students. Other people can easily use this app to explore Gent and to look up useful info on points of interest.
Because most of the people don't carry their tablet with them, we choose to optimize our interface for smart phones. This is done by maximizing the navigation buttons and by reducing the visible information on the screen. 

The navigation buttons use all the free space (in the horizontal direction). This results in less errors while navigating throughout the app.

Also the style of the app is adapted to our audience. We have chosen  to use a modern and stylish theme to attract more people to use our app.

Every activity contains the least possible amount of information. That way our app will also work on smaller screen smartphones. This is also the reason why we placed the 'login' button on a menu item in stead of a button on every activity. This reduces the used space and allows a user to login on every activity with only 1 click. Users who do not want to login are not bothered by this button.
