### Intended audience & usage context


The intended users for our app are students who are new to the city in which they are studying and are not yet familiar with all the interesting places and wish to know a bit more about the place they are visiting. But this is not restricted to students, other people can easily use this app to explore Ghent and to look up useful info on points of interest.

Because most of the people don't carry their tablet with them, we choose to optimize our interface for smartphones. This is done by maximizing the navigation buttons and by reducing the visible information on the screen. This results in less errors while navigating throughout the app.

The style of the app is adapted to our audience. We have chosen to use a modern and stylish theme to attract more people to use our app.

Every activity focuses on the most useful information and we minimize uneccessary items to ensure a distraction-free focus on what the user wants. That way our app will also work on smaller screen smartphones. This is also the reason why we placed the 'login' button on a menu item in stead of a button on every activity. This reduces the used space and allows a user to login on every activity with only 1 click. Users who do not want to login are not bothered by this button.
