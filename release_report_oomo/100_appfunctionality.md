## App Functionality

Students who are new to the city where they do their studies, in this case Ghent, often do not know of the interesting places to visit, like restaurants or cafes. These so called points of interest take some time to be found and explored by people who are not from the area. Because of that, they often miss out on actions or events in which they could be interested.

It is our intention to prevent this situation. With our app, students can find these points of interest in the neighbourhood a lot quicker. In particular, we focus on known outings, restaurants and cafes, things that are worth visiting as a student. The app can also provide useful information about these places, for example opening hours, prices, upcoming actions and events.

There is also a social aspect, with a friends list and an achievement system. This is to encourage people to visit as much of Ghent as possible and include their friends in this experience. We want to provide the student an unforgettable time in this city.
