### Different approach

* Android Studio instead of Eclipse: for better integration with
    * gradle : for missing dependencies
    * external services (travis-ci, coveralls,...)
* Development workflow
    * more branching
    * more rebasing/squashing meaningless commits
* Testing on wider range of devices
* More cities, focusing only on Ghent required us to fake the GPS data when we were not in Ghent.
